      <h1>Software With Purpose</h1>
      <p>Corkboard makes software to help you work smarter and get things done.  We focus on solving fundamental problems like data organization and team communication.  Our goal is to make web applications that just feel good.</p>

      <h1>Simple By Design</h1>
      <p>User experience is the most important aspect of software.  We emphasize simple, clean interfaces.  While our competitors worry about packing in more bells and whistles, we focus on getting the important features right.</p> 
      
      <h1>The Sweet Spot</h1>
      <p>Too much software is targeted at the extremes.  Our users have outgrown Excel but don't need 'enterprise solutions.'  Corkboard targets the sweet spot in the middle.  We use <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> because it delivers the best combination of power and speed.</p>
      
      <h1>See What Sticks</h1>
      <p>The Corkboard development process is based on collaboration.  The best software comes from close communication between users and developers.  We break down complex problems into small pieces and use fast iterations to deliver usable solutions.  We embrace agility.</p>
      
      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>In addition to client work, we also maintain a number of in-house products.  We're currently developing <a href="http://foodlab.tv">Food Lab</a>, a community cookbook.  <a href="http://yourdailysales.com">Daily Sales</a> is a web application for car dealerships.  We also run New Hampshire's best Wiffle Ball league at <a href="http://wiffled.com">Wiffled</a> and developed <a href="http://activebudget.org">ActiveBudget</a> to teach Ruby on Rails best practices.</p>
